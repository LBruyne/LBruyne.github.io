I have been serving as a Teaching Assistant and Assistant Lecturer for the undergraduate course "Blockchain and Digital Currency" at Zhejiang University from 2022 to 2024.

## Main work

I guide the students in writing Solidity contracts and designing full-stack Decentralized Apps (DApps).

- Each programming task is assigned and reviewed by me. The students are required to fork a GitHub repository and develop a DApp from scratch. The assignments from previous years can be found here: [2024](https://github.com/LBruyne/ZJU-blockchain-course-2024), [2023](https://github.com/LBruyne/ZJU-blockchain-course-2023), [2022](https://github.com/LBruyne/ZJU-blockchain-course-2022).
- Some useful course materials, primarily demos, can be found [here](https://github.com/LBruyne/blockchain-course-demos).
