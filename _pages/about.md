I am currently in my final year as a master's student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn), where I am pursuing an M.Eng. degree, under the esteemed guidance of [Prof. Xiaohu Yang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/xiaohu). I am currently visiting the Security Lab at National University of Singapore, working as a research assistant, where I am fortunate to be guided by [Prof. Jiaheng Zhang](https://zjhzjh123.github.io/). **I am currently seeking a Ph.D. opportunity**.

Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University. During my undergraduate studies, I had the honor of being part of the Advanced Class of Engineering Education (ACEE) at the [Chu Kochen Honors College](https://ckc.zju.edu.cn/), where I was surrounded by many outstanding peers and seniors.

My research interests primarily focus on blockchain, distributed systems, and applied cryptography, with a particular passion for zero-knowledge proofs. I am also fascinated by the potential of cryptocurrency, and I am committed to contributing to a future where privacy, security, and decentralization are paramount.

You can call me Hins (pronounced "Xuanming" in Cantonese), inspired by my favorite singer, Hins Cheung. I am a keen soccer enthusiast, with Kevin De Bruyne as my top favorite soccer player, and an avid player of Go (Weiqi).
